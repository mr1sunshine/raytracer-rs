# raytracer-rs

This simple raytracer implementation is a part of my journey to understand how graphic rendering works.
I'm following [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) book written by [Peter Shirley](https://www.petershirley.com/).
Basically I'm trying to rewrite all the examples from C++ to Rust.

This repository's goal is to learn more about raytracers and get more experience with Rust.

If you find any bugs or errors feel free to reach me on GH or provide a PR.
